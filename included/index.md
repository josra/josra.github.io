## Yearly meet-up

Up to two named persons in each corporation, will be set as contact and will be invited to the annual meet-up at no additional cost. During our meet-ups we will strive to reach roadmap decisions by consensus, but in the event that a majority vote is required on a subject, each corporation will be allowed to cast two votes.

Any person representing a member corporation can request membership to the JOSRA trello Organization and gain access to the [roadmap boards](https://trello.com/josra) as well as request membership of the [JOSRA group on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Joint-Open-Source-Roadmap-Alliance-7403229).
