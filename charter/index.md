## Name

The name of the alliance is "Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance". 

Although JOSRA is technically an abbreviation of the alliance's full name, it shall frequently be used as the actual name for the alliance and when used in text it shall be spelled as such with a capital J; _Josra_.

## Purpose and objectives

The purpose of Josra is to offer alliance members, who are dependant on Open Source technologies in their software development tool stacks, an active approach to become _innovators_ as opposed to _free riders_ and jointly and proactively, seek to improve the technologies in question to serve their specific interests.

The objective for Josra is to form a group of companionship, where the alliance members  through mutual trust and a shared wish of collaboration, will strive to seek out common interests and through a focused stake in Open Source technologies will be able to gain a higher pace of progress and maturity within the area of software development, than the individual company would otherwise have been able to establish single-handedly.

## Roles

Each Josra member organization will be appointing two persones to represent their membership in the alliance.

* Josra Membership Sponsor (*Chief*)
* Josra Tool Stack Advisor (*Geek*)

Each Josra member organisation is entitled to register more civil members (*Civilans*) who will be granted access to the Josra ressources and communication platforms.

Praqma will be represented by it's group of consultants (*Workers*) as well as project managers and organizers (*Facilitators*).

_The Josra Community_ shall be the term used to refer to the gross group - encompassing _chiefs_, _geeks_, _civilians_, _workers_ and _facilitators_.

## Structure

Josra is an alliance formed and facilitated by [Praqma](http://www.praqma.com).

Membership of the alliance is essentially defined by a _Josra membership contract_ between  Praqma and the individual member organization. The contract describes the conditions of the working relation under which delivery of consultancy and development by Praqma _workers_ and _facilitators_ is to be conducted.

### Members

Members will be listed here as they sign up. At this point we have a group of prospects. 

We refer to this group as _The founding Innovators_. It's defined by the group of companies who participated in reviewing the initial versions of the charter and the membership contact.

Members are listed chronically by their proclaimed intention to sign:

* [Yxlon International](http://www.yxlon.com){: target="_blank"}
* [Grundfos](http://www.grundfos.dk){: target="_blank"}
* [Atmel](http://www.atmel.com){: target="_blank"}
* [Volvo IT](http://www.volvoit.com/){: target="_blank"}

## Background and Scope

Praqma comes from a background where we have been facilitating and orchestrating contributions to jointly maintained pieces of software, not only within Open Source technologies but also within proprietary products maintained in a consortium like organization among danish NGOs.

We feel that we've come to a point where we now have so much experience in joggling this  type of collaboration networks, that we want to expand them to cover any Open Source technology desired by the Josra members.

## Funding

All alliance members will receive as, part of their annual membership fee, 40 hours of development work performed on tools in the Josra tool stack.

The 40 hours of work is made available to [The Member] as “punch card”. And can be invested in the members own initiatives or aas co-funding to other member's initiatives.

The work is not “punch out” on ongoing, unfinished work. Only when a cases is registered as resolved and closed will it be accounted for.

Funding can be used for:

* Maintenance of existing features in Open Source core or plugins 
* Development of new features in Open Source core or plugin 
* Configuration & adaptation of existing features in the JOSRA tool stack
* Research on Open Source technologies, including: 
    * Feasibility studies
    * Proof of technology studies
    * Documentation of Open Source technologies and features

The ruling concept for approving work within the Josra scope is that the work conducted should add value to the Josra tool stack in general.

In and case of doubt, wether a particular development case is regarded as within the Josra scope or not, the Josra community will be asked for arguments. Decisions will be made in consensus.

### Additional funding

If an alliance member is ambitious and wish to add more funding to development than the 40 hours included in the annual membership fee, more work hours can simply be purchased and added to the account.

This additional funding can be spent on the Josra alliance initiatives under the exact same conditions as the basic 40 hours

## Processes 

A typical process for engagement during the annual meetups could look like this:

1. Members of the Josra community maintains a dialog through cards and comments on the various [roadmap trello boards](www.trello.com/josra).
1. At some point an issue becomes so pressing for at membership organization that either the _geek_ or the _chief_ raises it to a development case.
1. The issue can be a bug, a feature request, a research request or a request for configuration or adaption. As soon as it's established that the requested work is indeed beneficial to the alliance as a whole, a _worker_ is assigned to the task and an official case is opened in the preferred issue tracking system for that particular Open Source tool. 
1. The _worker_ makes a qualified estimated of the work at hand and a call for co-funding goes out to the entire Josra community. Each member has 40 hours of work per year included in the membership, and they can support any suggested features they wish. Josra members who throw funding in a particular case will become part of the _stakeholder group_ for that particular case.
1. The _worker_ will stay on the case and maintain a continuous dialog with the _stakeholder group_ to make sure he gets sufficient feed-back and potentially also access to an environment where nature of the issue can be observed, investigated and developed.  
1. When the issue is solved, the solution is deliver to the respective Open Source community and the alliance members - as well as anyone else - can pull it from there.
1. Only when the issue is resolved and closed will the amount of hours spent on the issue be punched out on the "punch cards" of the stakeholders.
1. The feature is guaranteed support and maintenance in at least 12 month after it's delivery.

## Josra Tool Stack
The Josra tool stack includes all tools, technologies and extensions developed under the individual Josra membership and any other Open Source tool that the alliance members jointly agrees to maintain within the alliance.

The basis of the collaboration is initially the tool stack that _The Founding Innovators_ has been working on for quite some while together with Praqma - essentially that is made up of 8-10 plugin for Jenkins with a accumulated user base counting hundreds of installations (2000+ as of September 2014).

### How the tool stack expands
The scope of the Josra tool stack is theoretically anything Open Source.

If an alliance member, either alone or as part of a _stakeholder group_, chooses to fund a development case that leads to a release, then that particular tool and the delivery will be maintained within the scope of Josra for a period of at least 12 months. And the tool will effectively be regarded as included in the Josra tool stack.

__An example:__

Say a member wishes a new feature - perhaps a new mojo in Maven - but Maven is not currently part of the Josra tool stack.

The procedure is exactly the same, as if it was already in the tool stack ([described earlier](#processes)): The development case is defined and estimated and a request for co-funding is issued. 

Even if the member can't form a _stakeholder group_, the member can still choose to carry on with the development case as the sole funder - and the tool will effectively become part of the Josra tool stack.

## Annual meetup

At least once every year, Praqma is responsible for organizing a meetup, that shall be open to all Josra community members.

The annual meetups shall seek hosting facilities and venues at the membership organizations. Expenses for catering, venues etc shall be covered by Praqma.

Each alliance member is entitled to register two self-appointed organization representatives to participate at the annual JOSRA meetup representing the roles _Chief_ and _Geek_. 

Access to the annual Josra meetup in the roles as _Chief_ and _Geek_ are included in the membership.

Each alliance member is entitled - and encouraged - to send more participants to the annual meetup than just the two designated roles. Additional meetup participants will be charged a meetup fee to cover the venue and catering costs of the meetup.

### Meetup agenda and workshops

During meetups the agenda will look roughly like this

* Breakfast
* Status - achievements since last meetup, welcome new members
* Lightning talks - members present ideas through a series of short 15 minute presentations
* Workshops form around the issues presented - trying to form _stakeholder groups_ (funding).
* Lunch
* Another session of workshops.
* Conclusions from workshops are presented and captured as the roadmap to follow until the next meetup.
* Keynote - either  a member prepared something spectacular or someone from "the outside" is brought in.
* Dinner

## Roadmaps

Roadmaps are maintained individually for each tool in the Josra tool stack.

Roadmaps are organized as Trello boards in Josra's organization on [www.trello.com/josra](www.trello.com/josra).

## Collaboration platforms

The alliance activities and collaboration platform is maintained through:

* Continuous dialog between Praqma _workers_ and _facilitators_ and the member organization's _geek_, _chief_ and _civilians_
* Josra's organization on [Trello boards](http://www.trello.com/josra)
* The annual Josra meetup - where the entire Josra community meets
* Josra's organization on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/josra)

### Social

* Twitter account [@josraorg](http://www.twitter.com/josraorg)
* Twitter hashtag [#josra](https://twitter.com/hashtag/josra?src=hash)

## Josra case management

All issues are initiated through the various roadmaps, maintained through Trello Boards at: [www.trello.com/josra](www.trello.com/josra)

When an issues is raised to development or maintenance case, a ticket is created in the case management system designated or preferred by the corresponding Open Source community. 

E.g for Jenkins CI that system is [issues.jenkins-ci.org](issues.jenkins-ci.org).

If no naturally designated case management system exist for a given case. Praqma's incident management system will be used - cases can be opened simply by mailing them to [support@praqma.net](support@praqma.net).

## Josra related internships

Through engagement with DIKU and Copenhagen Business School Praqma hosts Computer Science interns from both Master, Bachelor and AP courses. 

We’ve currently hosted more than 2o interns and we’re constantly defining and offering challenging internships for students at the educational institutions that we’re collaborating with. We’re engaging interns in Open Source related assignments and challenges. These internship programs can potentially span hundreds of effective work hours by talented computer scientists and craftsmen in-spe.

As part of the Josra alliance members are encouraged to collaborate with Praqma to define new assignments for these talented interns. Praqma offers to host the internships and offer guidance, mentorship and education in an master/apprentice like relation, while JOSRA alliance members are encouraged to participate in the role as “product owner” for a specific challenge.

Significant contributions to Open Source technologies has been made through these Praqma internships over time.

## Intellectual Property, Copy rights and Open Source license

All code produced in scope of Josra is to become Open Source.

Code will be delivered as Open Source and licensed by the appropriate Open Source licence, typically the license recommended by the respective Open Source Community.

If no license type is recommended by the respective Open Source community, a _university style_ license such a M.I.T or BSD is chosen

Copy rights on Open Source code will belong to the maintainer – by default Praqma – unless agreed differently by among the _stakeholder group_ of a particular delivery.
