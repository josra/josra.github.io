## Name

The name of the alliance is "Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance".

Although JOSRA is technically an abbreviation of the alliance's full name, it shall frequently be used as the actual name for the alliance and when used in text it shall be spelled as a proper noun, with a capital J; _Josra_.

## Purpose and objectives

The purpose of Josra is to offer alliance members, who are dependent on Open Source technologies in their software development tool stacks, an active approach to become _innovators_ as opposed to _free riders_ and jointly and proactively, seek to improve the technologies in question to serve their specific interests.

The objective for Josra is to form a group of companionship, where the alliance members through mutual trust and a shared wish of collaboration, will strive to seek out common interests and through a focused stake in Open Source technologies will be able to gain a higher pace of progress and maturity within the area of software development, than the individual company would otherwise have been able to establish single-handedly.

## Roles

Each Josra member organization will be entitled and encouraged to appoint two persons to represent their organizations membership in the alliance.

* Josra Membership Sponsor (*chief*)
* Josra Tool Stack Advisor (*geek*)

Each Josra member organisation is entitled to register more civil members (*civilans*) who will be granted access to the Josra resources and communication platforms.

Praqma will be represented by it's group of consultants (*workers*) as well as project managers and organizers (*facilitators*).

_The Josra Community_ shall be the term used to refer to the gross group - encompassing _chiefs_, _geeks_, _civilians_, _workers_ and _facilitators_.

## Structure

Josra is an alliance formed and facilitated by [Praqma](http://www.praqma.com).

Membership of the alliance is essentially defined by a _Josra membership contract_ between Praqma and the individual member organization. The contract describes the conditions of the working relation under which delivery of consultancy and development by Praqma _workers_ and _facilitators_ is to be conducted.

### Members

Members will be [listed on josra.org](/members/) as they sign up.

## Background and Scope

Praqma comes from a background where we have been facilitating and orchestrating contributions to jointly maintained pieces of software, not only within Open Source technologies but also within proprietary products maintained in a consortium like organization among Danish NGOs.

Our mission is to expand that kind of joint development of software to Open Source technology, since we believe that having more shoulders to carry the burden of developing and contribution with ideas and features represents a truly modern approach to software development.

## Funding

The primary work in Josra is financed from the joint pot.

For each signup or renewal of an annual alliance membership, there will be added 40 hours of work to the common _Josra pot_, all these work hours will be spent on development cases creating and maintaining tools and technologies in the Josra tool stack.

Josra memberships will be renewed, and invoices for the membership fee sent out,  annually on the effective date of the individual member contracts.

Josra pot is administrated by Praqma and used for:

* Maintenance of existing features in an Open Source project.
* Development of new features in an Open Source project.
* Configuration & adaptation of existing features in the Josra tool stack.
* Research on Open Source technologies, including:
    * Feasibility studies.
    * Proof of technology studies.
    * Documentation of Open Source technologies and features.

The Josra pot is administrated by Praqma and the ruling concept for approving work within the Josra scope is that the work conducted should add value to the Josra tool stack in general and be relevant to the Josra members.

At each Josra gathering the members will agree on a roadmap for the next 6 month, setting the direction for the activities that are not strictly related to maintenance of existing projects.

### Additional funding and stakeholder groups

Occasionally an alliance member wish to initiate a project or development case, which is to be considered out of the ordinary to be financed from the joint pot. Either because it's too big to fit or because it has limited interest to the Josra members in general.

An alliance member is welcome to add more funding to a specific project to be run in Josra context, Josra related work can be offered at a favorable and discounted price.

When a member is adding additional funding to a development case, we will strive to seek co-funding and a _stakeholder board_ is formed. All members contributing additional funding to the cause are invited to have a seat at the _stakeholder board_ of that development case. The _stakeholder board_ is then jointly serving the role as _product owner_ through out the span of the work case.

## Processes

A typical process for executing work within Josra looks like this:

1. Josra members gather frequently in groups, or they interact and communicate through cards and comments on the various [roadmap boards in Trello ](http://www.trello.com/josra).
1. At some point through the dialog, a development case emerges and it's described as a _Statement of Work_ (SoW) on the Josra web and announced in a posting to the Josra members through the official news mail list.
1. If any Josra members wish to challenge the SoW, they should do so immediately, as work is initiated as soon as the SoW is releasd.
1. Praqma will organize, manage and facilitate the process. If a Josra member  throws _additional funding_ in a particular case, that member will become part of the _stakeholder group_ for that particular case.
1. The _worker_ will stay on the case and maintain a continuous dialog with the _stakeholder group_ to make sure he gets sufficient feed-back and potentially also access to an environment where the nature of the issue can be observed, investigated and developed.
1. When the case is resolved, the solution is deliver to the respective Open Source community and the alliance members - as well as anyone else - can pull it from there.
1. The feature is guaranteed support and maintenance in at least 12 month after it's delivery.

## Statement of Work
A Statement of Work (SoW) will be prepared and announced on the Josra mail list prior to any non-trivial task.

The SoW will describe the following:

* Problem or scope
* Suggested solution
* Estimate
* Definition of Done

## Josra Tool Stack

The Josra tool stack naturally includes all tools, technologies and extensions previously developed in the context of Josra and any other Open Source tool that the alliance members jointly agrees to maintain within the alliance.

### How the tool stack expands

The potential scope of the Josra tool stack is _anything Open Source_.

If an alliance member, either alone or as part of a _stakeholder group_, chooses to fund a development case that leads to a release, then that particular tool and the delivery will be maintained and supported within the scope of Josra for a period of at least 12 months. And the tool will effectively be regarded as included in the Josra tool stack.

__An example:__

Say a member wishes a new feature - perhaps a new mojo in Maven - but Maven is not currently part of the Josra tool stack.

The procedure is exactly the same, as if it was already in the tool stack ([described earlier](#processes)): The development case is defined and estimated and a SoW briefing is issued to the members.

Most typically new tools are added to the tool stack as a consequence of a _stakeholder group_ jointly funding a development case.

## Gatherings

At least once every half year, Praqma is responsible for organizing a gathering, that shall be open to all Josra community members.

The gatherings may be hosted at facilities and venues at the membership organizations. Expenses for executing the gatherings shall be covered by Praqma.

Each alliance member is entitled to register two self-appointed (_chief_ and _geek_) organization representatives to participate, free of additional cost, at the Josra gatherings.

Each alliance member is entitled to send more participants to the gtherings than just the two designated roles. However, additional gathering participants may be charged a meetup fee to cover the venue and catering costs of the gathering.

At least two gatherings per year will we _general assemblies_, where the members will gather and discuss status and roadmaps for the next half-year period.

Occasionally gatherings with a specialized topic will be arranged. All members with interest in the particular topic is entitled and encouraged to participate.

The gatherings - general as well as specialized - are _decision meetings_. Members who wish to influence are encouraged to attend.

## Roadmaps

Roadmaps are maintained individually for each tool in the Josra tool stack.

Roadmaps are organized as [Trello boards in Josra's organization](http://www.trello.com/josra).

## Collaboration platforms

The alliance activities and collaboration platform are maintained through:

* Continuous dialog between Praqma _workers_ and _facilitators_ and the member organization's _geek_, _chief_ and _civilians_.
* Josra's organization on [Trello boards](http://www.trello.com/josra)
* The Josra gatherings - where the entire Josra community are encouraged to participate.
* Josra's organization on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/josra)
* Praqma's organization on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/praqma)
* Josra's news mail.
* Josra's twitter account [josraorg](http://twitter.com/josraorg)

### Social

* Twitter account [@josraorg](https://twitter.com/josraorg)
* Twitter hashtag [#josra](https://twitter.com/hashtag/josra?src=hash)

## Josra case management

All issues are initiated through the various roadmaps, maintained through the [Josra Trello Board](http://www.trello.com/josra)

When an issues is raised to development case, a ticket is also created in the case management system designated or preferred by the corresponding Open Source community.

E.g for Jenkins CI plugins that system is [https://issues.jenkins-ci.org](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org), if no recommended or de facto system exists for a particular product, we will use the features provided by GitHub.

If no naturally designated case management system exist for a given case. Praqma's incident management system will be used - cases can be opened simply by mailing them to [support@praqma.net](mailto:support@praqma.net).

## Josra related internships

Through engagement and partnerships with a series of academic institutions, Praqma is frequently hosting computer science interns from both Master, Bachelor and AP courses.

We currently have a formal working relation with:

* Computer Science Department at University of Copenhagen (DIKU).
* CPH Business Academy
* IT-University (ITU)
* Computer Science Department at University of Lund. (Lunds Universitet)

Since Praqma was founded in 2007 we have been hosting more than 21 interns and we’re constantly defining and offering challenging internships for students at the educational institutions that we’re collaborating with. We’re always engaging interns in Open Source related assignments and challenges. These internship programs can potentially span hundreds of effective work hours by talented computer scientists and craftsmen in-spe.

As part of the Josra alliance, members are encouraged to collaborate with Praqma to define new assignments for these talented interns. Praqma offers to host the internships and offer guidance, mentorship and education in an master/apprentice like relation, while Josra alliance members are encouraged to participate in the role as _product owner_ for a specific challenge.

Significant contributions to Open Source technologies have been made through these Praqma internships over time. The ClearCase UCM plugin for Jenkins, the Pretested Integration pluing for Jenkins and the GCC compliancy of the Memory Map plugin for Jenkins are all products that were initiated as intern projects.
