A Statement of Work (SoW) is like the equivalent of a _briefing_ or an _epic_.

It's a high level description of a concrete problem, issue or feature. together with the proposed solution and a short elaboration into the design and technology planned for the implementation.

Essentially, it describes a possible delivery and covers the following:

* Goal statement
* Suggested solution
* Estimated workload (â‰ˆ price)
* Deliverables

## The SoW needs funding
SoW's are created when a project or a feature needs additional funding.

When new members join Josra, more hours are added to the pot. The pot is used to maintain , release, support and stabilize existing Josra releases and technologies.

Anything _new_ will require funding, preferably co-funding, from the members.

The SoW's typically stem from the Josra members themselves, ideas and visions discussed and elaborated at the Josra gatherings that are being investigated and the made tangible in SoW's.

## How to fund Statement of Works
Each SoW will have a doughnut chart, showing the current commitments, the funding still needed and the threshold for starting - typically when 90% of the estimate is committed.

The process works much like a Kickstarter project:

* If you see a SoW you'd like to contribute to, fill out the [SoW funding form](/sow/) - let us know how much you'd like to contribute.
* You will receive a quote - you can use that to prepare a Purchase Order internally in your organization if necessary.
* We will update the doughnut chart on the SoW accordingly.
* When the "Go!" threshold is reached and the project goes live, we will start the work and send out invoices matching the quotes.
* Hopefully the remainder of the funding will trickle in - otherwise we will take it off the pot.
* We will deliver within budget. If we overrun the estimate, it's our treat.
* The delivery will become available as open source.
* The features delivered will be maintained by the Josra pot.
