We need to send out SoW's before we start working on issues and tasks.

What's in a SoW

* Problem (refer to issues)
* Solution
* Brief design description
* Expected work load

* Mention the details about where the work is updated (Trello?, Jira? GitHub)

Keep it brief - make it half a page (400-700 chars)
