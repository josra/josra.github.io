__PLEASE plan to stay over, book a hotel, socializing in the evening should be considered mandatory - some of the best ideas in the world started out as drawings on dinner napkins!__

You should book your hotel in Trondheim City. Atmel recommends [Radisson Blue Royal Garden Hotel](https://www.radissonblu.com/en/hotel-trondheim){: target="_blank"} Book over the phone and, ask for the Atmel negotiated price which is NOK 910,- per night, refer to _Heidi Hassel at Atmel_ if necessary.

_Due to the dense program for the day, we will utilize our slack team: [josra.slack.com](http://josra.slack.com){: target="_blank"} to share information and ideas in advance. So prepare yourself for a bit (not a lot) of home work reading prior to the meeting._
