## Can I join - even if I'm not a member of Josra?

__Yes! ...and you should!__

Actually if your interested in Josra, but not yet signed up, then reading the Josra News Channel will give you a pretty good idea of what it means to be a member: You'll be following all the work as an observer - until you become so envy on the privileged insiders - that you decide to join.

_Tag along - your are more than welcome!_
