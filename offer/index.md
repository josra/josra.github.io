# Josra membership fee

<div class="stdcenter"><img src="/images/josra-fee.png"/></div>

The membership fee per corporation is initially set to __7,000 EUR__ per year. 

As listed in the [included](/included/) section, the membership - among other benefits - entitles you to up to 20 support or development cases per year with the first two hours of each case already included.

If you are already an established client with Praqma in other matters, we can offer you to exchange this benefit into 30 hours of consecutive work - only requirement is that the work is contributing to the tools in JOSRA's tools stack.

###Early adaptors are rewarded!

_The 7K€/Y:) is a discounted rate that we will guarantee the first 20 members who join the alliance._
