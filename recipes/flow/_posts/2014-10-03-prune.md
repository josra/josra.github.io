title: Clean out local ready branches
author: Lars Kruse

Your local clone will potentially have `ready/*` branches hanging around that probably might already be integrated and deleted both on `origin` and on the clone at the Jenkins slave.

You want to clean out these branches.

### The problem in a nut shell

The branches comes from the process where you deliver:

    git push origin my-dev:ready/my-dev

As you deliver ready branches from your local clone using this approach `ready/*` branches will be created to trace the corresponding branch on `origin`. But up there they'll just be deleted as soon as integrated.


### How to do it

The key here is to _prune_ local branches when synchronizing with `origin`. Pruning is available as a switch `-p` or `--prune` on the `fetch` command.

So simply run the following command to clean up:

    git fetch origin --prune
